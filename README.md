# How to start the backend server

Just type in the terminal when you are in the current-sea-back folder "npm start".
You can then use your browser by going to http://localhost:4000/ and checking that you see the test message.

I have also set up some tools to help us with development and consistency. You can check out all the packages I installed in package.json in the current-sea-back folder.

Happy coding! :-)
